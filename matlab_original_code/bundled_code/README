-- These Matlab scripts can be used to produce the results from Tavor et al. Science 2016

-- Dependencies:
   - Matlab (we used 2014a but it should all work with previous versions)
   - FSL 5 (www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl)
   - Workbench (www.humanconnectome.org)
   - FastICA toolbox (http://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/fastica)
   - Graph_toolbox (https://github.com/gpeyre)
   
-- It is assumed that FSL and Workbench can be called from matlab using the unix() command

-- Scripts:
   -- Feature creation

      do_group_pca_rfmri.m : run incremental group PCA on resting data to feed into group ICA

      rfmri_feature_extraction.m  : create resting FMRI features

      struct_feature_extraction.m : create structural features


   -- Training and predictions

      run_all_predictions.m : train piecewise GLMs and make LOO predictions
